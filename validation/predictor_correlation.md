\# Predictor Correlation Assessment



Potential multicollinearity among predictor variables was evaluated conceptually based on ecological relationships and known dataset properties.



The selected predictors represent distinct environmental dimensions:



\- Temperature (thermal conditions)

\- Precipitation (moisture availability)

\- Seasonality (climate variability)

\- Elevation (topographic gradient)

\- Land cover (surface characteristics)



Because each variable describes a different ecological factor, strong collinearity is unlikely at the conceptual level.



Formal statistical correlation testing (e.g., Pearson correlation matrix or Variance Inflation Factor analysis) was not performed in this version of the model and is identified as a priority improvement for future iterations.



Future validation will include quantitative multicollinearity diagnostics to ensure predictor independence.
