# Limitations



- No species occurrence data used

- Expert-based thresholding

- No statistical validation

- Hypothetical species niche assumptions



This model is intended as a workflow demonstration.





Additional limitations include:



- coarse spatial resolution (~1 km)

- global datasets may not reflect local microhabitats

- categorical land cover simplification

- absence of uncertainty quantification
